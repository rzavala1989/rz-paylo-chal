# Introduction

This is for potential job placement. I have tried my best to abide by the honor system and not spend _too_ much time in this application.

Frontend is built with NextJS
Backend is built on a Prisma server with a Postgres database

I chose Next.js and Prisma because these two as a pair are designed to scale easily, so they can be used to build applications that are capable of handling large amounts of traffic and data
